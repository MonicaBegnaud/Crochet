## Patterns I've done

[Circular Mandala](assets/mandala.pdf)

My first big project. It was part of a CAL that worked up over about 4 weeks. I was working on it with a group of friends so we each had a different color scheme going on. You needed 8 different colors for this pattern... We would tease each other about who's was going to come out the best and I joked saying that mine would be even though it was the first big thing I had ever attempted.

[Baby Blanket](assets/gentle-waves.pdf) 

This was the very first pattern I ever learned. It took me weeks to figure out the first row. The instructions and just crochet in general was not making sense, it finally clicked out day at 2 in the morning and the blanket was finished that same day. It was given as a baby shower gift for a co-workers first child after holding onto it for almost 4 years.

[Throw Blanket][assets/blanket.pdf]

Similar to the mandala but practicing with making corners similar to a [[granny square]]. This one took me almost over a year because I just keep stopping and starting. The problem with patterns that spiral out is the sides start to take longer and longer the bigger it gets and then the stitch starts to become repetitive and was struggling to maintain interest. I gave this one to my friend as a birthday present and her dog immediately claimed it.
