# What is a Crochet Pattern
There are several different formats you can find crochet patterns in. 
1. A written pattern: that you read and work your way through row by row or round by round depending on what you are trying to make. These will use the abbreviations for each [[stitches/index|stitch]].
- Example: Round 1 (right side): Ch 4 (counts as dc, ch 1), dc in ring, (ch 1, dc in ring) 10 times, ch 1; join with slip st in 3rd ch of beginning ch-4â€”12 dc and 12 ch-1 spaces

2. A picture pattern: this will have very minimal words and can be either a full example of the completed work or for larger patterns will show you just a section that you will repeat x number of times.

3. Videos: an increasing number of people are using streaming platforms such as youtube or TikTok to record themselves as they work through a project and you follow along as they go. 

# What Type of Pattern is Best?
That depends on each individual crafter. People who are bran new to crochet sometimes find watching video explanations easier because the content creator will usually be narrating and adding helpful tips as they go along. Someone just starting out might also not be familiar with all of the abbreviations or how to read a visual pattern yet.  

But other people are visual learns and having something where you can mark off each step as you go helps them stay on track.

There are several creators who do what are called crochet alongs (CAL). A pattern will be selected and released, then each week a certain amount of rows will be done for the pattern. There will be videos instructions more focused on that week's portion instead of the whole pattern and you work along with the whole group doing the same pattern. 
# Can I Make Up My Own Pattern?
Of course! If you can't find a pattern you like for a particular project then there is nothing stopping it from creating your own. Once you have have any understanding of the [[stitches/index|different stitches]] you can start experimenting with different [[techniques/index|techniques]] until you find something that give you the look that you want.
