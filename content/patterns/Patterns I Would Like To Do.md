One of the things I would really like to make time for this year is making my family crochet Christmas stockings. I think the would be more meaningful being handmade instead of just a generic one from the store. Also I would really like for there to be an uniform look as they hang on my mantel, but as my family grows they just don't make sets of things for 7 without repeating colors. I've I made them myself everyone could pick exactly what color or two they wanted them to be.

I would also like to make a set of these potholders. We have several crochet potholders made by my mother in law and they seem to hold up better than more of the plain fabric ones. Also this pattern has three different layers of yarn that build up so I think it would be a challenging pattern to work through. Along with being able to make a set of all our favorite pies.
