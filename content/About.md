# My Crochet Vault

This website will be a comprehensive knowledge base containing information about all things crochet. It is designed not only as a way to keep myself organized and on top of current projects, but to act as a reference source for others as well. 

I want it to be easy to follow but also fun and informative. 
## Categories
- A guide to different hook sizes and how to make a gauge swatch.
- A pattern sections: with links to patterns I have completed as well as have saved for later. 
- Information about the different types of stitches and how they are represented in a pattern.
- The different styles or techniques that can all be called crochet even though they have different approaches. 
- Talk about different types and weights of yarns for different project uses.
