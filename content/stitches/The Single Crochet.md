# The Single Crochet 
A single crochet is a very good stitch to start with because it will give you an idea of how to manipulate the yarn on the hook and the following stitches will build on that idea. Similar to the slip stitch above you will yarn over, but this repeat the action twice and pull the yarn through both loops you have created. This is the primary stitch used for [[amigurumi]].

This stitch is also used whenever you want your project to heavy. A group of single crochets together will have very little space in between them, your project will come out very tight and very firm as you can see in the pattern for the Christmas Stockings I have on my [[Patterns I Would Like To Do|To-Do List]].

In a written pattern a single crochet will be abbreviated (sc).

In a pattern diagram it will be represented by an X.
