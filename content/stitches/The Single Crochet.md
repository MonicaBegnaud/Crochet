## The Single Crochet 
A single crochet is a very good stitch to start with because it will give you an idea of how to manipulate the yarn on the hook and the following stitches will build on that idea. Similar to the slip stitch above you will yarn over, but this repeat the action twice and pull the yarn through both loops you have created. This is the primary stitch used for [[amigurumi]].

In a written pattern a single crochet will be abbreviated (sc).

In a pattern diagram it will be represented by an X.
