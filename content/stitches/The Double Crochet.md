## The Double Crochet 
The double crochet will combine steps from the single and half double. You will follow the same first step as the half double but instead of pull the yarn through all three loops you will only pull it through the first two. Then you will yarn over again so that you have two loops on the hook and pull the yarn through both like a single crochet. 

This is a popular stitch because of the height it adds to your project. If you want to do something simple that works up quickly you can make entire blankets just by doing row after row of double crochets. It will also be commonly used in [[granny square|granny squares.]]

In a written pattern a double crochet will be abbreviated (dc).

In a pattern diagram it will be represented by a T with a single line through it.
