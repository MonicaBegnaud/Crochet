# Can You Count?
Probably the most important question you will ask yourself while working on any crochet project. From experience, let me tell you to be prepare for the answer to be no. Especially when you are first starting out it can be very difficult to look at a work in progress and be able to identify each stitch to make sure you have the number you're supposed to. Stitch markers and a good sense of organization will be critical for keeping yourself on track and making sure your project comes out the shape you want. 
# How Many Stitches?
There are an endless number of different crochet stitches. The same stitch could be known by several different names, and people are constantly creating new stitches as they wrote new patterns. But there are a few main stitches that you should master before getting into the more complicated stuff.
