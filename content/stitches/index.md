# How Many Stitches?
There are an endless number of different crochet stitches. The same stitch could be known by several different names, and people are constantly creating new stitches as they wrote new patterns. But there are a few main stitches that you should master before getting into the more complicated stuff.

# The Six Basic Crochet Stitches

## 1. The Chain Stitch (ch)
Almost every project will begin by asking you to make a foundation by making some number of chain stitches. This will be the base that every other row of your project builds on. It is exactly what it sounds like, you are making a series of interconnected loops that your hook will go back into for the next row. 

## 2. The Slip Stitch (sl)
This is the smallest stitch, it will not add any height to your project. It is used more to join different parts of your work together. Or is can be used as an accent that goes on top of a previous row to add a different texture. To make the skip stitch you will make a loop on your hook by taking your tail and wrapping it over the hook, then pulling that loop through. 

## 3. The Single Crochet (sc)
A single crochet is a very good stitch to start with because it will give you an idea of how to manipulate the yarn on the hook and the following stitches will build on that idea. Similar to the slip stitch above you will yarn over, but this repeat the action twice and pull the yarn through both loops you have created. This is the primary stitch used for [[amigurumi]].

## 4. The Half Double (hdc)
Basically every stitch in the last three are just going to be increasing the number of loops you have on your hook. For the half double you are going to want to yarn over and pull up loops until you have three on your hook. You will then pull the yarn through all three loops at once. 

## 5. The Double Crochet (dc)
The double crochet will combine steps from the single and half double. You will follow the same first step as the half double but instead of pull the yarn through all three loops you will only pull it through the first two. Then you will yarn over again so that you have two loops on the hook and pull the yarn through both like a single crochet. 

## The Treble Crochet (tr)
This stitch can also be referred to as the triple crochet, the two names are used interchangeably. Just like the previous stitches the name refers to how many times your are going to pull the yarn through the loop on your hook. Your are going to yarn over until you have four loops on your hook, pull through the first two like you would for the double, and then yarn over and pull through two loops a total of two more times.
