## The Half Double
Basically every stitch in the last three are just going to be increasing the number of loops you have on your hook. For the half double you are going to want to yarn over and pull up loops until you have three on your hook. You will then pull the yarn through all three loops at once.  

In a written pattern a half double crochet will be abbreviated (hdc).

In a pattern diagram it will be represented by an elongated T.
