## The Half Double
Basically every stitch in the last three are just going to be increasing the number of loops you have on your hook. For the half double you are going to want to yarn over and pull up loops until you have three on your hook. You will then pull the yarn through all three loops at once.  

As the name would suggest, this stitch is a middle ground between the single and the full double crochet. It adds almost the same amount of height you would get from a double crochet but it is not as heavy as all single crochets. If you want your project to have more of a drape feeling this would be a good option. 

In a written pattern a half double crochet will be abbreviated (hdc).

In a pattern diagram it will be represented by an elongated T.
