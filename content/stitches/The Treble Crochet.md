# The Treble Crochet
This stitch can also be referred to as the triple crochet, the two names are used interchangeably. Just like the previous stitches the name refers to how many times your are going to pull the yarn through the loop on your hook. Your are going to yarn over until you have four loops on your hook, pull through the first two like you would for the double, and then yarn over and pull through two loops a total of two more times.

The triple crochet will give you a lot of height very quickly but I can find it to be very time consuming as you have to yarn over and pull the yarn through your loops so many times just to create one stitch. 

In a written pattern a treble crochet will be abbreviated (tr).

In a pattern diagram it will be represented by a T with two lines through it.
