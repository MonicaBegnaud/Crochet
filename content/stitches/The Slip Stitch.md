## The Slip Stitch
This is the smallest stitch, it will not add any height to your project. It is used more to join different parts of your work together. Or is can be used as an accent that goes on top of a previous row to add a different texture. To make the skip stitch you will make a loop on your hook by taking your tail and wrapping it over the hook, then pulling that loop through. 

You can see a good example of a row of slip stitches in the below picture of my throw blanket. If you look at the outside light blue edge you can see how the beginning edge of the border stands out slightly and almost makes a channel between it and the very edge of the blanket. 

In a written pattern a slip stitch will be abbreviated (sl).

In a pattern diagram it will be represented by a solid dot.
