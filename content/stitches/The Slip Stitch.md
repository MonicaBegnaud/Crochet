## The Slip Stitch
This is the smallest stitch, it will not add any height to your project. It is used more to join different parts of your work together. Or is can be used as an accent that goes on top of a previous row to add a different texture. To make the skip stitch you will make a loop on your hook by taking your tail and wrapping it over the hook, then pulling that loop through. 

In a written pattern a slip stitch will be abbreviated (sl).

In a pattern diagram it will be represented by a solid dot.
