# The Hook
Arguably the most important part of any crochet project is going to be your hook.  The basic shape of the crochet hooks is going to stay the same but there are several different sizes. The size of a crochet hook refers to the diameter of the hook portion which then determines how big your [[stitches/index|stitches]] will come out. 

Hook sizes will be listed either by an MM value or a corresponding letter.

# Gauge Swatch
What is a gauge? Everyone crochets slightly differently. Depending on how tightly you hold your yarn your stitches could come out larger or smaller than the pattern even if your are following it 100%. To try and combat this a lot of pattern with include a gauge swatch at the beginning. This is a quick example of the stitch work up that you do before the project to make sure your scale is going to match the intentioned design. If your swatch is larger or smaller you may need to use a different hook size that the one the pattern calls for.
