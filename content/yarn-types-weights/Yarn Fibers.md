# What Is a Fiber?
When we talk about different yarn fibers it is just fancy way of saying what material the yarn is made out of. You can make a "yarn" out of just about anything that can be woven together into a workable strand. I have done projects using everything from pure cotton to strips of grocery store plastic bags that I knotted together at the ends.

# Most Common Fibers
If you're just wondering into your locale craft store looking for a place to start the most common yarns you'll find on the shelves are
1. Acrylic (which is a synthetic fiber)
2. Cotton
3. Wool

If you're looking for something a little fancier, and are willing to pay a little more, high end options include
1. Silk
2. Alpaca
3. Bamboo

And of course there are lots of blends of the above options that are good for most projects.

# How Do I Choose?
When picking a yarn the most important consideration is what the final project will be used for. If you want to make something for a baby, you're most likely going to want to pick something that will be soft on their skin. If you are making a potholder, you're going to want something heavy duty that is not super flammable.
