# What Does Yarn Weight Mean?
When we talk about yarn weight, you are not talking about the number on a scale if you were to weight your skein. You are talking about the actual thickness of the strand of yarn itself. It's not a perfect system, every brand will differ slightly but in gives you a general idea of how thick/heavy a project will be. 

There are 8 different weights. and they will be labeled on the skein wrapper, using with a recommended hook size.

# How Do You Choose a Weight?
As I mentioned the best place to start when choosing your yarn is by looking at your pattern, in the beginning introduction section there will be a material list.

Now of course your are not required to follow this to the letter. If you want to take the pattern for a plushie that uses a 3 or 4 weight yarn and follow the pattern directions with a jumbo yarn there is nothing stopping you. Just be aware that you will need substantially more yarn and that it could come out a lot bigger than you expect...
