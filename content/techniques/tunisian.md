## What is Tunisian Crochet?
Tunisian crochet is a kind of mix between normal crochet and knitting. Instead of your standard [[hook-sizes-gauges/index|crochet hook]] you instead use a very long hook that can hold many loops at a time. Your normal crochet will generally only have one stitch at a time. The end result of a Tunisian project will also be thicker, so many people like it for things like blankets and sweaters. 

### What stitches do I need to know?
Tunisian stitches are completely different from your normal crochet stitches.  It is almost as if you are learning a completely different craft.

>* Tunisian Knit Stitch 
>* Tunisian Purl Stitch (that one doesn't even pretend it's not knitting)

#### Differences from normal crochet
Aside from the specialized hook needed for Tunisian, another difference is the actual method of stitching. For Tunisian each row involves two parts. 

1. The initial forward pass, where you pick up however many loops your pattern calls for a hold them on your hook.
2. The "return" pass, where you go back and close each loop letting it off of your hook.
