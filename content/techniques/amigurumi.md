## What is Amigurumi?
Amigurumi is a Japanese style of crochet where you are typically creating a small plushie or 3D object.  Once you get toward the end of your amigurumi pattern you are going to fill/stuff the inside before finishing it off. 

### What stitches do I need to know?
The primary [[stitches/index|stitch]] used a single crochet, which is one of the basic stitches you first learn. Then it is all about whether or not you really know how to count. Be prepared for the answer to be no. Most amigurumi patterns are worked in the round, so having so type of stitch marker comes in very handy.  

### How big can I make my plushie?
The overall size of your plushie will depend on [[hook-sizes-gauges/index|the size of the hook]] you choose to use. Most patterns will be written using a smaller hook, leading to small tight stitches.  But you can use whatever size hook you prefer and create giant life-sized plushies if that's what your goal is.
