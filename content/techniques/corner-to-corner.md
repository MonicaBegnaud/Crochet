## What is Corner-to-Corner?
As the name would suggest, for this type of crochet you will start at one corner of the pattern and make diagonal rows across to the opposite corner.  The end result will look verify similar to a cross stitch pattern, where your design is made up of different color blocks. 

### What stitches do I need to know?
Each square of your pattern will be made up of chains and [[stitches/index|double crochets.]] Most patterns will include a grid with the image you are trying to recreate overlaid, or in some cases since every square is made the same way the entire pattern could just be the grid itself with a color guide and [[hook-sizes-gauges/index|a size gauge.]]

### How big can I make my project
The great thing about corner-to-corner is you can make your project as big or small as you want. You could design a very intricate picture and make it the size of a blanket. Or have it be very simplistic and the size of a small pillow or wall hanging.
