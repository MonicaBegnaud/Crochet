# Crochet is Crochet Right?
Wrong. Crochet is a very broad term and it refers to the use of a single hook to create your pattern instead of two needles like you would use for knitting. You are also for the most part, going to only have one loop on your hook at a time. Again unlike knitting where the first step is filling your needle with loops and then the second part is going back and closing the loops. With crochet you are going to close each one as you go. 

Can you tell people who crochet really don't like when people refer to them or their work as "knit"?
