## What is Tapestry Crochet?
Tapestry is very similar to both Corner-to-Corner and just your traditional crochet. As you work along your patter you are going to carry several different colors through to make your chosen design.  Similar to the C2C your pattern may include a written explanation and/or a chart of your design. Again similar to cross-stitch, your crochet will be a 1:1 recreation of a grid. Maybe people will find cross stitch patterns and use them for crochet and vise versa depending on your particular interest.  

### What stitches do I need to know?
You will primarily be using [[stitches/index|single crochets]] but the difference is you will be switching between  several different colors of yarn as you work. You can either carry your colors across the rows, weaving in the unused color, or you can cut your yarn into smaller balls for each section. But then if you're anything like me you'll finish the project and never go back and hide your ends. A dangerous game that can lead to all your hard work coming unraveled with a single pull.
